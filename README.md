# Petrinet Interface Visualizer
The Petrinet Interface Visualizer is a programs that allows users to draw and edit petri net models. The program was 
written in C++ and built with QT 5.11.

# Vision
This visualizer is intended to create petri net models to represent biological reactions or events for simulation purposes. The program
would allow users to create petri net models of molecular reactions and save the data of the models to a file. The program 
would also be to read in data from such a file for users to edit the models.

Data from the user created models could be fed into a biological reaction simulator. Such simulator would use the data it 
recieved to compute results about the possible outcomes of the molecular reactions and generate results that could be used to predict the 
possible outcomes of biological events. When creating or editing, users can change the stucture of the models, the inputs and outputs of an event, and manipulate the biological attributes of the molecules or events. Users would manipulate such attributes to values that would affect simulations that the data would be used on.
